# Efficient Large Language Model (LLM) Decoding 

## Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Llama have recently gained a lot of attention. However, operating them is still quite costly. The expense of generating a single response, which might be around $0.01 for a brief interaction using an 8xA100 instance on AWS at the moment, can become substantial when considering billions of users engaging in multiple interactions daily. Certain tasks, such as code auto-completion which activates with each new character typed, are particularly resource-intensive. As LLMs are increasingly employed in various applications, even minor improvements in generation efficiency can lead to significant overall cost reductions.

The process of LLM inference, or "decoding", is sequential, with tokens being produced **one at a time**. To generate complete sentences of `N` tokens, the model must go through `N` iterations. The good news is that it's possible to store previously computed tokens, meaning that each step of generation isn't influenced by the total length of the context. The exception is the attention mechanism, which doesnâ€™t scale as efficiently with the length of the context.

## Project Objective
Our goal is to investigate and integrate advanced acceleration methods for LLM decoding. We plan to evaluate these methods using GPU benchmarks, drawing insights from several key papers:

1. **[FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf)**
2. **[FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Enhanced Parallelism and Work Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08691.pdf)**
3. **[FLASHDECODING++: Accelerated Large Language Model Inference on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01282.pdf)**
4. **[PagedAttention: Optimized Memory Management in LLM Serving with PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180.pdf)**

Our ultimate goal is to synthesize the best features from these studies to create an innovative, more efficient decoding algorithm.

## Traditional LLM Decoding Algorithm
The conventional LLM decoding algorithm depends significantly on the self-attention mechanism, which, while effective, is a primary source of computational inefficiency in LLMs.

### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism is crucial in neural networks, especially for natural language processing. It dynamically concentrates on certain parts of the input sequence to produce each part of the output, similar to selective human attention.

Here's a basic formula for self-attention calculation:

![Self-Attention Mechanism](media/attn_equation.png)
    
where `Q`, `K`, and `V` are query, key, and value matrices, respectively. The attention score is calculated by multiplying the query and key matrices, and the weighted sum is calculated by multiplying the attention score and the value matrix.

---

### Computational Intensity and Equations
From the equation, we can obersereve that the computational intensity of the attention mechanism stems mainly from calculating attention scores and generating weighted sums, which involve complex matrix operations in LLMs. However, we've chosen not to prioritize direct optimization of these operations because:

- They are fundamental to the model's functionality and accuracy.
- Alterations could potentially compromise the quality of the model's output.

### IO-Bound Nature of Attention
Attention efficiency is often restricted by IO operations, particularly in large-scale models, due to:

* **High Memory Bandwidth Usage**: Extensive data access is required for attention calculations.
* **Sequential Data Access**: Operations like matrix multiplication can't fully utilize modern hardware's parallel processing.
* **Data Transfer Overheads**: Significant overheads occur when transferring large datasets in distributed or GPU-based systems.
Enhancing IO efficiency is crucial for improving LLM performance.

### KV Cache as an Optimization Vector
An additional direction for optimization is the Key-Value (KV) cache. Optimizing the KV cache can lead to:

* **Reduced Redundancy**: By efficiently caching and reusing key and value pairs, the need for recalculating these elements for each decoding step is minimized.
* **Enhanced Speed**: Streamlining the access and retrieval process from the KV cache can significantly speed up the decoding process.
* **Lower Memory Footprint**: Efficient caching reduces the memory requirements, which is particularly beneficial for models operating on limited-resource environments or aiming for real-time applications.

So, in this project, we mainly focus on the optimization fo the IO-bound nature of attention and the KV cache, which is discuessed the FlashAttention and PagedAttention papers respectively.

# FlashAttention Algorithm
## FlashAttention-1
FlashAttention-1 introduces an IO-aware optimization to the attention mechanism. It significantly reduces memory usage and enhances processing speed by optimizing data flow between memory and processing units.

## FlashAttention-2
Building upon FlashAttention-1, this version further improves parallel processing and workload partitioning. It aims to maximize GPU utilization and reduce latency in LLM decoding.

## FlashDecoding
FlashDecoding focuses on optimizing the entire LLM decoding pipeline for GPUs. It restructures traditional decoding algorithms to better suit the parallel nature of GPU architectures.

## FlashDecoding++
FlashDecoding++ is an advanced version that further refines GPU utilization strategies. It introduces novel techniques for managing large-scale language model inference, thereby boosting decoding speeds significantly.

# PagedAttention Algorithm
This is an attention algorithm inspired by virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. This approach divides a request's key-value (KV) cache into blocks, each containing attention keys and values for a fixed number of tokens. Unlike traditional methods, these blocks are not stored in contiguous space, allowing for more flexible memory management similar to the operating system's virtual memory. By avoiding contiguous space caching, we reduce both internal and external fragmentation in GPU memory. This leads to more efficient memory utilization, enabling the handling of larger batch sizes and consequently achieving higher throughput.
